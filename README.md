# TrainDashboard
Grafana Train Departure and Station-Info System

The dashboard provides information about departures at a station listed by Deutsche Bahn. The dashboard can find the desired station via a free text input and provides additional information such as the availability of parking, bicycle parking, Wifi or toilets. It also includes a small statistics section. 

In order to get data for the dashboard, an Enwtickler account on the Api marketplace of Deutsche Bahn is necessary. https://developers.deutschebahn.com/db-api-marketplace/apis/frontpage
